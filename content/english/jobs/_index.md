We look forward to telling you more about Dataworkz, Big Data and want to hear even more about what you are really looking for in a company: Send your CV or your LinkedIn profile to [info@dataworkz.de](mailto:info@dataworkz.de). We will contact you the same day. We will invite you for an introduction in which we will have a chat about whether Dataworkz suits you. If that is the case, you will meet two of our engineers. This is mainly about technical inspiration. Will we both go home with new ideas? In that case, changes are high that we are going to have a lot of fun together!
