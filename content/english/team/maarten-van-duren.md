* **Motorbike gloves**: When the weather is nice, I like to ride my bike. Quietly touring through the polders or on dyke roads.
* **Whisky**: I like to drink a good whisky once in a while.
* **Multimeter**: I regularly work on home-automation, my car or my motorbike. Then you regularly have to solder, measure cables or repair circuits.
* **Tools**: I am often working in and around the house. I also have a motorbike and an old American car, of which I do all the maintenance and restoration myself. So you need good tools for that.
* **Formule 1**: I have been following Formula 1 since my student days. It is a special sport and I don't want to miss a qualification or a race.
* **Corvette**: With this manual and my two right hands I can do all the maintenance on my Corvette. Of course I like to drive it. Especially in the summer, making a tour with the top off. 
* **Headphones**: On the road, I like to listen to my favourite music, especially rock and music by the famous artists of the '70s and '80s.
