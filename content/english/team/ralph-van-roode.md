- **Drive** I'm fascinated by people and why they do the things they do! 
- **Driver** Every thing with a ball can keep my busy. Combine that with nature, and I'm all game!
- **Tiny Tony's** Arguably the best chocolate around. And I love chocolate!
- **Running shoe** Just because there is to much sugar in chocolate. And it helps me to clear my head.
- **Baseball glove** Love baseball and love playing catch with my son even more. And yes, I do have a bigger glove myself.
- **Airpods** Can't live without them anymore. Proffesionaly, and to listen to music (mostly while running).
- **Italien wine** Both Italy and wine and high on the list of things me and my wife love. Visiting small wineries in Italy brings everything together. 
- **Tennis racket** Played it since I was a kid. I've done so many different sports, I think tennis is still one of my favority sports to do. 
- **Wire brush** Firing up the Barby, with friends or family. Love food, that helps! 
- **Bill Hicks** Humor is very important to me. And Bill Hicks is of of my favorites. "Live if just a ride!"
- **Mokum cap** Lived in Germany for over 10 years (and love it here). But Mokum (Amsterdam) always makes me feel at home.
