* **Juggling balls:** Good way to clear my head.
* **Swiss army knife**: Indispensable item for camping and hiking!
* **Muse headband:** Neuro-feedback device for meditation. Also a nice gadget.
* **Factfulness book**: Hans Rosling is one of the people who inspired me, with his emphasis on facts and positive view of the world.
* **Star Disc:** Once an amateur stargazer, then physics & astronomy as a study. The universe remains interesting.
* **Travel Guide Ethiopia:** Backpacking and getting to know new cultures.
* **Thermoscan**: Never be far from a cup (or jug) of tea.
* **Chess pieces:** Mediocre chess player, but always have fun.
* **Pickel**: Mountaineering. Fantastic combination of nature, challenge (both physical and mental) and inner peace.
* **Climbing shoes:** Initially started climbing, lately mainly bouldering.
