* **Tools:**  I like to spend my weekends doing home improvement work, and tackling small and large renovation projects.
* **Laptop:**  Good work also needs good tools. In this case, a powerhouse with GPU and dual boot, (Windows for administration, Linux for the heavy work)
* **Panlid:** I also like to work with good tools in the kitchen. In this case, a cast-iron pan for a delicious stew in the cold days. No quick bites, but gentle cooking and a nice smell in the house.
* **GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach:** Patterns are all around us; this book compares patterns from mathematics, art, and music. It is a tough pill to swallow if you have trouble with math.
* **Swimming gear:** I love being the last one in the pool at night and doing laps of breast-crawling. In the fast lane of course, and trying to swim technically well with as few strokes as possible.
* **Rubik's cube:** I like a great puzzle. Everyone has one, and the 3x3x3 is easy to learn (my record is 30 seconds), then it's time for the 4x4x4. I usually keep it in the car (for in traffic jams).
* **Machine Vision:** A syllabus of an inspiring professor (Leo Dorst) at the UvA. He inspires and talks with his fingers. That is where it all started for me.
