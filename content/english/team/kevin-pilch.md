* **Motorcycle helmet**: Motorcycling is freedom. My motorcycle should not have a windshield, needs a good suspension and lots of power -- everything else is secondary!
* **Books**: Books are magical. They compress the knowledge of smart people into snack-sized, high quality information, and help me to improve myself one book at a time. 
* **Caliper**: Mechanical engineering amazes me! I love to check out technical systems while trying to understand their design and how they work. Vehicles, machines or buildings are equally interesting!
* **Running shoe**: I started running out of frustration for not being able to run a 5k. Torment turned into ambition and finally into a habit, which has incredibly positive effects on my mind and body.
* **Portafilter**: Espresso, Flat White, Americo or V60 -- I love light-roasted specialty coffee in all forms and shapes.
* **Chef knife**: Cooking good food is a great joy and an important part of my everyday life. I prefer light, plant-based dishes, preferably in good company!
* **Piano**: I love making music. I started playing the drums as a child and later picked up playing guitar. My latest challenge is learning to play the piano!
