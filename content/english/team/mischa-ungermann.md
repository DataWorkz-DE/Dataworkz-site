- **Coffee Maker** Coffee is life. And delicious!
- **Controller** A hobby I rediscovered during a global pandemic: Wow, there are great video games around!
- **Notebook** Even though you can't grep dead trees, nothing helps sorting your thoughts than writing things on paper.
- **Glass from Hesse** I really like living in the north, but still I miss sometimes the many great things about the region where I grew up: Forests, hills, or refreshing apple wine.
- **Woolen Socks** There should be more warm and comfy clothes in the world!
- **Cat toy** I live with two cats who you might get to know if you ever invite me to a video meeting.
- **Headphones** Yes.
- **Frisbee** I played Ultimate Frisbee for a long time, and even if my body tries to convince me to switch to something else, I still can't let go of this amazing sport.
- **Climbing Shoe & Brush** Climbing and bouldering started as my surrogate drug for Frisbee, but at the moment it seems that it might take over my life.
