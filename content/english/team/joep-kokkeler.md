* **Balls**: Proof that 4 piece does not have to be expensive. Better feel than a prov1 and finer roll than a tp5x.
* **Clubs**: Because custom clubs are important, there is nothing off the shelf in my golf bag. Now I just need to work on play my game.. 
* **Ereader**: One of the few kickstarter-type things I have backed that was successful and could deliver. Never leave home without it. Now all I need is a nice handwriting...
* **Ghost**: Another kickstarter that did see the light of day and also managed to reach my house. Although the second game of this object was very disappointing, I have no regrets about the 3d printer that mades it possible.
* **Glasses**: Swapped the sports glasses for real glasses. Although the sports one is still used when cycling, I can no longer do without the other.
* **Macbook**: Always complained about it being overpriced, no upgrades possible, few ports, but since the switch never looked back for anything else.
* **Shoe (under armour)**: I have never worn a shoe that felt so good in the grass. This is already the 2nd pair of the same shoe; the other one broke due to heavy use.
* **Shoe (mavic)**: Apart from golf, I also spent a lot of time and energy on my racing bike. It does not fit on the photo but the shoes on it do.
* **Shoe (nike)**:This orange shoe runs so well that I have run a number of pb's with it. I'll allow myself to use it again if I can get close to my pb's again.
* **Sketch**: From earlier work, there is still a piece of love for design in this, meanwhile the books from Affinity Photo and Designer have been added.
* **Whatif**:Followed since https://www.xkcd.com/303/ and if you don't have this book in your closet, you are not a real nerd.
