* **Coffee**: Cannot live without one, love to drink whatever delicious version there is. Always down for caf√© hopping, any season anywhere.
* **Kindle**: My love for detective (whodunit) and fiction novels are unmatched. An excellent companion during a long trip.
* **Nintendo Switch**: Necessary for taking a break to have a great fun!
* **(Flower) Lego**: Lego and jigsaw puzzle to disassociate from the world. Essential during winter time.
* **Workout stuff**: As a fan of exercising indoors, casual weightlifting in the gym or functional training at home with my mat is the way to go.
