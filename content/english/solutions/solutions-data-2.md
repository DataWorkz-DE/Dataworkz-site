**Data pollution is expensive!** Most organisations state, that an estimated 25% of their data in inaccurate, a factor that strongly influences the business result.  This is best explained in the  **1-10-100 rule**:  If it costs you 1 euro to prevent a data mistake, it will cost you 10 euro to fix it afterwards- and 100 euro is a problem is created by this mistake.

Our approach ensures that companies prevent data pollution at the source, the data pipeline. 

**We build automated tests in your data pipeline to prevent any dirty data effecting your business. **

**In roughly 2 weeks' time** we will, with the support of your domain specialist: 

* Build in an automated data test framework within your existing data pipeline;
* Program one data pipeline completely with automated tests; 
* Support you in workshops to provide you with knowledge you need, for you to (test) automate the rest of your data pipelines yourself.
