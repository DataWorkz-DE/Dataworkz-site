## What data do we collect?
If you contact us through the contact options offered, your details will be stored so that they can be used to process and respond to your enquiry. We process personal data based on consent according to Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR, which you are free to give or refuse. These data will not be passed on to third parties without your consent. You will find an e-mail address, contact form and a postal address to contact us and for (unsolicited) job applications on our website. If you contact us, your data will be stored. These data are in particular:

The following personal data:
- Your name
- E-mail address
- Telephone number
- Address
- Subject
- Message with (optional) attached data
This information will not be passed on to third parties. The data will only be processed within the scope of your contact request or job application.

When you visit our website, it is technically necessary for data to be transmitted to our web server via your Internet browser. The following data is recorded during an ongoing connection for communication between your internet browser and our web server:
- Date and time of the request
- Name of the requested file
- Page from which the file was requested.
- Access status
- Web browser and operating system used
- (Complete) IP address of the requesting computer

We collect the listed data in order to guarantee a smooth connection establishment of the website and to enable a comfortable use of our website by the users. The log file also serves to evaluate system security and stability as well as administrative purposes. For reasons of technical security, in particular to prevent attempts to attack our web server, we store this data temporarily. Based on this data, it is not possible for us to draw conclusions about individual persons. After 14 days at the latest, the data is anonymised by shortening the IP address at domain level, so that it is no longer possible to establish a reference to the individual user.

## How do we collect your data?
You directly provide Dataworkz GmbH with most of the data we collect. We collect data and process data when you contact us via phone, e-mail or contact form.

## How will we use your data?
Dataworkz GmbH collects your data so that we can respond to your contact request and/or job application. We do not share your personal data with third parties, except:
- if we have explicitly pointed this out in the description of the respective data processing,
- if you have given your express consent,
- the disclosure is necessary for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims and there is no reason to assume that you have an overriding legitimate interest in not disclosing your data,
- in the event that there is a legal obligation to pass on data, and
- to the extent required for the execution of contractual relationships with you.

In addition, we use external service providers for the processing of our services, whom we have carefully selected and commissioned in writing. They are bound by our instructions and are regularly monitored by us. If necessary, we have concluded contract processing agreements with them. These are service providers for web hosting, sending e-mails, maintenance and servicing of our IT systems, etc. The service providers will not pass this data on to third parties.

## How do we store your data?
Dataworkz GmbH securely stores your data using Microsoft Office365 services.
The duration of the storage of personal data is determined by the relevant statutory retention periods (e.g. from commercial law and tax law). After expiry of the respective period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted. If data is required for contract fulfilment or contract initiation or if we have a justified interest in further storage, the data will be deleted if you are no longer required for these purposes or if you make use of your right of revocation or objection. The storage periods for the application documents of accepted applicants are subject to the storage periods from the employment relationship. The applicant will receive further information in due course. The application documents of rejected applicants will be deleted immediately.
