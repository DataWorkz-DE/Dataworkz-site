Inspiring each other and sharing knowledge. How can we achieve this when we often work at customers' premises? At Dataworkz we therefore regularly have Workzpoor Thursdays, where we work at the office in the Werkspoor Cathedral, helping each other and our customers. Experiences are shared during lunch sessions and evening workshops. We ended with our now traditional thai dinner and of course a small beer.
