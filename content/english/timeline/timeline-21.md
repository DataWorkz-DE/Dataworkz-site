Working from home. Keeping a distance, no high-fives. That is pretty hard for us. But we do everything in our power to be together even remotely, like the home wine tasting! And the meetups continue, for example in cooperation with the Human & Tech Institute on bias testing and ethics in AI. 

We find that with our spacious office we can easily comply with the distance rules and so the consultancy world is turned upside down. Instead of working at the client's, clients and their teams come to us - to finally see each other live again.
