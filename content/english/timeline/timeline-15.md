This year, we are visiting the ODSC in London again with the whole club, but of course it was extra special to speak at the Big Data Days in Moscow. Arno and Bogdan presented Data Science as a Service and how image recognition can save parking costs in a smart way. And if you get the chance to speak in Moscow, we can't let them go alone so we were there with a nice delegation to attend the conference and see Moscow in between.
