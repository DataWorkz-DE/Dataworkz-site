Was one of the most successful meetups 2019 with over 90 participants. With a meetup every 2 months and guest speakers, we now count 600 members in the meetup group. We will tell you how to train a neural network with GraphQL, how to get the most out of your data with Reinforcement and Transfer learning and of course how to know in advance when Dutch cows are in heat.
