With around 40 guests, we rented an entire floor of the water tower in Utrecht for our annual Christmas dinner. There were many socials this year, such as kite flying, golfing, a day at Walibi or simply going out in Rotterdam, but enjoying a festive and luxurious Christmas dinner is always one of the highlights.
