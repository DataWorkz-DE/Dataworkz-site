We are stoked that our Olaf will be presenting at the ODSC how he can predict the bitcoin market with Tweets. Not only because we are very proud of this, but especially because it leads to many inspiring conversations with and without beer - with direct results for our clients (like the deployment of AutoML). And because it's so much fun, we'll be speaking at Devoxx Belgium, Hashidays, Teqnation and the JFall.
