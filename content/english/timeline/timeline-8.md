With 5 meetups now, we are up to speed and together with Hashicorp we explain how to make multicloud platforms secure. It is especially nice to do meetups with customers together, like with the Port of Rotterdam, where we jointly explain how Data Science Serverless works on land, in the sea and in the cloud.
