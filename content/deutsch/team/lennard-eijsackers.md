* **Guitar**: I have been playing guitar for years, and I love the creative freedom it gives me. 
* **Hamburgers book**: Good food is something I enjoy. Both eating and cooking good food, although I must admit that I am more of a gourmet then a chef. I am particularly fond of a good hamburger.
* **Vektor â€“ Outer Isolation**: As you might have guessed from the guitar, I a Heavy Metal fan. I especially enjoy the more progressive and technically proficient bands, which are pushing the boundaries of music. Vektor is a Progressive Thrash Metal Band.
* **E-reader**: As a new year's resolution for this year I want to read 24 books. I enjoy filling my e-reader with software related books. 
* **Magic the Gathering Deck**: I love playing games, both board games and computer games. My all time favorite game is Magic the Gathering, a game in which both strategic insight and a good bluff matter.
* **Dune**: I am a huge SciFi nerd, and love everything relating to Star Wars, Marvel, Lord of the Rings etc. Dune is one of my all time favorite SciFi books.
