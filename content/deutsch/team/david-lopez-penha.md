* **Guide Books**: They represent my love for traveling, i.e., being exposed to new places, people and cultures
* **Delft Blue Houses**: These are miniature “replicas" of traditional Dutch houses; the one on the right is found in Amsterdam (my city of birth), and the one on the left is found in Willemstad, Curaçao (where my family is from)
* **Watercolour Paintings**: Represent my tropical roots (St. Maarten & Curaçao)
* **(Bamboo) Tea Whisk**: For my love of tea
* **Wave Motion**: For my interest in the computing and mathematical sciences (with a specialty in transport theory / logistics)
* **Spatula & Whisk**: These are indispensable in a baker’s kitchen. They represent my love for food, cooking and baking. “Laughter is brightest in the place where food is” — Irish proverb
