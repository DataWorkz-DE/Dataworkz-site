  title: About Dataworkz
  image: images/about/about-us.jpg
  content: It all started in the winter of 2016 with an innocent phone call and dinner with the current
    shareholders. The idea was quickly born to create a cool technical data club. Data is becoming more 
    and more important in daily (working) life. From idea to start was a pretty hectic period but for us
    it was always important to put our employees at the centre of the organisation. Connecting with your 
    people and doing cool things for our customers, that is the core of Dataworkz.
